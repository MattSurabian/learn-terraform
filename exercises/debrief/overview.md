# DEBRIEF
Over the past several weeks we've worked together learning about application 
deployment and infrastructure management tools and work flows. After 
completing the learn terraform class you should feel confident reasoning 
about these topics and discussiong them with your colleagues.

## Learn SSH
 - Why should we trust the server?
 - Why should the server trust us?
 - What are some ways to protect our keys?
 - How can a user manage multiple keys and usernames across many servers?

## Learn Ansible
 - What does it mean to treat servers like cattle instead of pets?
 - How do we keep deployment scripts from getting out of date?
 - What should always be the first steps in debugging any Ansible deployment error?
 - Is Ansible the right configuration management solution? What other options 
are out there?

## Learn Terraform
 - What is the difference between what Ansible provides and what Terraform 
provides?
 - What does it mean to have provider flexbility and what are some real world
  implementation level considerations of a switch over?
